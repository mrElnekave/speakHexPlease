Happy Birthday!

-On this USB lies a special program:
-It teaches you to speak hexadecimal.
-
-Hopefully it will help enrich your vocabulary (～￣▽￣)～
-
-Please don't take it too seriously but try to figure out how the system is structured.


Hope you have fun, and sorry for messing up the Happy birthday song, and the packaging...

Good luck!
